# mexa_power

The **mexa_power** project is developed for **mexa hacheton**. This repository contains the following components:

## 1. Dataset Folder

This folder contains:

- Code to generate the **synthetic dataset** used for training.
- The **synthetic dataset** itself.
- Code for converting this data into **JSON files** to be used for fine-tuning purposes.

The dataset is a key part of the project, enabling the training of models and fine-tuning based on synthetic data for better performance in specific tasks.

## 2. LLM Training

The **llm_training** file demonstrates how we use the synthetic data to **fine-tune large language models (LLMs)**, specifically **Gemini**. This file shows how the dataset is used to prompt-feed the model, optimizing its performance for the intended tasks.

## 3. Personal Wellbeing Dashboard (GUI)

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** has been developed that allows users to interact with the synthetic data and generate personalized wellbeing insights. This interface is powered by the trained LLM and provides a user-friendly way to view and analyze the data.

- The **dashboard** is designed to display personal wellbeing metrics.
- A **screenshot** of the GUI is provided in this repository to showcase its functionality.

## Project Overview

This repository aims to enable the creation of customized wellbeing dashboards using AI-driven insights. By utilizing synthetic data and a fine-tuned LLM model, we provide a tool for users to monitor and track their wellbeing in a personalized manner.
